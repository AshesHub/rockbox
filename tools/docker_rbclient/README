This directory builds a Docker container image for a rockbox build
client with all toolchains except android.

There is a pre-built client available as built1n/rbclient on Docker
Hub if you would like to avoid having to build all the toolchains. See
the Docker documentation on how to pull and run it.

To build from scratch:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed and running.

2. Run:

  docker build . -t myclient

  This will build the image and tag it as `myclient.'

3. To run your client:

  docker run -e USER=your username -e PASS=anything -e NAME=clientname \
             myclient

  You can also run a bash shell interactively by issuing:

  docker run -it myclient bash

  This will drop you into a fully-equiped rockbox development
  environment.

It is also possible to pull straight from Docker Hub. Run:

  docker pull built1n/rbclient
  
Then you can use all the commands above, with `myclient' replaced with
`built1n/rbclient'.
