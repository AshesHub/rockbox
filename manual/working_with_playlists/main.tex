\section{\label{ref:working_with_playlists}Working with Playlists}

\subsection{Playlist terminology}
Some common terms that are used in Rockbox when referring to
playlists:

\begin{description}
\item[Directory.] A playlist! One of the keys to getting the most out of
  Rockbox is understanding that Rockbox \emph{always} considers the song that
  it is playing to be part of a playlist, and in some situations, Rockbox will
  create a playlist automatically. For example, if you are playing the
  contents of a directory, Rockbox will automatically create a playlist
  containing all songs in it. This means that just about anything
  that is described in this chapter with respect to playlists also applies to
  directories.

\item[Dynamic playlist.]  A dynamic playlist is a playlist that is created
  ``On the fly.'' Any time you insert or queue tracks using the
  \setting{Playing Next Submenu} (see \reference{ref:playingnext_submenu}), you are
  creating (or adding to) a dynamic playlist.

\item[Play/Add.] In Rockbox, to \setting{Play} or \setting{Add} an item means
  putting it into a playlist and leaving it there, even after it is
  played.

\item[Queue.] To \setting{Queue} a song means to put it into a playlist, but then
  to remove the song from the playlist once it has been played.
\end{description}

\subsection{Creating playlists}

Rockbox can create playlists in four different ways.

\subsubsection{By selecting (``playing'') a song from the File Browser}
Whenever a song is selected from the \setting{File Browser} with
\ActionTreeEnter, Rockbox will automatically create a playlist containing
all of the songs in that directory and start playback with the selected
song.

\note{If you already have created a dynamic playlist, playing a new
  song will \emph{erase} the current dynamic playlist and create a new one.
  If you want to add a song to the current playlist
  rather than erasing the current
  playlist, see the section below on how to add music to a playlist.}

\subsubsection{By using the Play or Play Shuffled functions}
The \setting{Play} function as described in \ref{ref:playingnext_submenu}
will replace the dynamic playlist with the selected tracks. The \setting{Play
Shuffled} function is similar, except the selected tracks will be added to the
playlist in a random order.

\subsubsection{\label{ref:addtoplaylist_submenu}By using the Add to Playlist submenu}
The \setting{Add to Playlist submenu} makes it possible to modify and create
playlists that are not currently playing. To do this select \setting{Add to Playlist...}
in the \setting{Context Menu}. There you will have two choices,
\setting{Add to Existing Playlist} adds the selected track or directory to an existing
playlist and \setting{Add to New Playlist} creates a new playlist containing
the selected track or directory.

\note{All playlists in the \setting{Playlist catalogue} are stored by default
  in the \fname{/Playlists} directory in the root of your \daps{} disk and
  playlists stored in other locations are not included in the catalogue. It is
  however possible to move existing playlists there (see
  \reference{ref:Contextmenu}).}

\subsubsection{By using the Main Menu}
To create a playlist containing some or all of the music on your \dap{}, you can use the
\setting{Create Playlist} command in the \setting{Playlist Catalogue Context Menu}
(see \reference{ref:playlistcatalogue_contextmenu}).

\subsection{Adding music to playlists}

\subsubsection{\label{ref:playingnext_submenu}Adding music to a dynamic playlist}
\screenshot{rockbox_interface/images/ss-playlist-menu}{The Playing Next Submenu}{}
The \setting{Playing Next Submenu} is a submenu in the \setting{Context Menu} (see
\reference{ref:Contextmenu}), it allows you to put tracks into a
``dynamic playlist''. The place in which the newly
selected tracks are added to the playlist is determined by these
options:

\begin{description}
\item [Play Next.] Play track(s) immediately after the currently playing track.

\item [Add.] Add track(s) after the most recently added tracks or, if tracks
have not been added yet, immediately after the currently playing track.

\item [Play Last.] Add track(s) to the end of the playlist.

\item [Add Shuffled.] Add track(s) to the playlist at random positions.

\item [Play Last Shuffled.] Add tracks in a random order to the end of the playlist.
\end{description}

If you'd like to replace the current playlist with the new selection, the
following two options will achieve that effect.

\begin{description}
\item [Play.] Replace all entries in the dynamic playlist with the selected
  tracks. If \setting{Keep Current Track When Replacing Playlist} is set to
  \setting{Yes}, the new tracks will play after the current track finishes
  playing; if no track is playing or the setting is \setting{No}, the new
  tracks will begin playing immediately.

\item [Play Shuffled.] Similar, except the tracks will be added to the new
  playlist in random order.
\end{description}

Another possibility is to add tracks \emph{temporarily} to the dynamic playlist.
In Rockboxâ€™s parlance, this is called queuing. Queued tracks are automatically
removed from the playlist after they have been played. They are also not saved
to the playlist file (see \reference{ref:playlistoptions}).

\begin{description}
\item [Queue Next.] Corresponds to \setting{Play Next}.

\item [Queue.] Corresponds to \setting{Add}.

\item [Queue Last.] Corresponds to \setting{Play Last}.

\item [Queue Shuffled.] Corresponds to \setting{Add Shuffled}.

\item [Queue Last Shuffled.] Corresponds to \setting{Play Last Shuffled}.
\end{description}

\note{Visibility of options to add shuffled tracks or to queue tracks can be toggled by going to
\setting{Settings} $\rightarrow$ \setting{General Settings} $\rightarrow$ \setting{Playlists}
$\rightarrow$ \setting{Current Playlist}. Select either \setting{Show Shuffled Adding Options}
or \setting{Show Queue Options} to customize the displayed set of options.}

The \setting{Playing Next Submenu}  can be used to add either single tracks or
entire directories to a playlist. If the \setting{Playing Next Submenu} is
invoked on a single track, it will put only that track into the playlist.
On the other hand, if the \setting{Playing Next Submenu} is invoked on a
directory, Rockbox adds all of the tracks in that directory to the
playlist.

\note{You can control whether or not Rockbox includes the contents of
  subdirectories when adding an entire directory to a playlist. Set the
  \setting{Settings $\rightarrow$ General Settings $\rightarrow$ Playlist
  $\rightarrow$ Recursively Insert Directories} setting to \setting{Yes} if
  you would like Rockbox to include tracks in subdirectories as well as tracks
  in the currently-selected directory.}

Dynamic playlists are saved so resume will restore them exactly as they
were before shutdown.

\note{To view, save, reshuffle, or display the play time of the current
  dynamic playlist use the
  \setting{Playlist} sub menu in the WPS context menu or in the
  \setting{Main Menu}.}

\subsection{Modifying playlists}
\subsubsection{Reshuffling}
Reshuffling the current playlist is easily done from the \setting{Current Playlist}
sub menu in the WPS, just select \setting{Reshuffle}.

\subsubsection{Moving and removing tracks}
To move or remove a track from the current playlist enter the
\setting{Playlist Viewer} by selecting \setting{View Current Playlist} in the
\setting{Current Playlist} submenu in the WPS context menu or the \setting{Main Menu}.
Once in the \setting{Playlist Viewer} open the context menu on the track you
want to move or remove. If you want to move the track, select \setting{Move} in
the context menu and then move the blinking cursor to the place where you want
the track to be moved and confirm with \ActionStdOk. To remove a track, simply
select \setting{Remove} in the context menu.

\subsection{Saving playlists}
To save the current playlist either enter the \setting{Current Playlist} submenu
in the \setting{WPS Context Menu} (see \reference{sec:contextmenu}) and
select \setting{Save Current Playlist} or enter the context menu for the
\setting{Playlist catalogue} in the \setting{Main Menu} and select
\setting{Save Current Playlist}.
Either method will bring you to the \setting{Virtual Keyboard} (see
\reference{sec:virtual_keyboard}), enter a filename for your playlist and
accept it. If the current playlist contains any queued tracks, you will be
asked whether to remove them, as a prerequisiste for creating bookmarks
(see \reference{ref:createbookmark}).

\subsection{Loading saved playlists}
\subsubsection{Through the \setting{File Browser}}
Playlist files, like regular music tracks, can be selected through the
\setting{File Browser}. When loading a playlist from disk it will replace
the current dynamic playlist. If you want to look at a playlist's
content without starting playback immediately, access the \setting{Context Menu} (see
\reference{ref:Contextmenu}) with \ActionStdContext{} and choose \setting{View}.

\subsubsection{Through the \setting{Playlist catalogue}}
The \setting{Playlist catalogue} offers a shortcut to all playlists in your
\daps{} specified playlist directory.
It can be used like the \setting{File Browser} but will display
the content of a playlist when one is selected.
